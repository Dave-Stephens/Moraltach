So, let’s get to the prospectus of the company and what it is setting out to achieve.  There is a profile in the company prospectus that reads thus: “ Moralltach initially concentrated its main focus on the Irish property market including property development. The Company later focused on the Green Energy Market; in particular, the Waste to Energy Sector as it became apparent that good opportunities were available in the sector. “Now, as you know, the Green Energy Market and the Waste to Energy Market sectors are very high on the Global agenda to decrease and alleviate the Carbon Footprint on this planet. This will obviously garner further interest from the current and future investors. Moralltach have a very unique business model which is also found in the Moralltach prospectus and this is how it’s described:“The Company’s business model covering property development is based on a unique variant of the leaseback arrangement often used in real estate transactions. Moralltach offers to purchase the property from the owner at an independently appraised value. The owner is paid with Shares of the Company’s stock, priced at a premium price to the market.”This Win-win situation for the investor is extended to the Waste To Energy Business, in the paragraph:“Similar leaseback arrangements are also arranged on many of the Company’s green energy projects. In this profit sharing example, Moralltach owns the facility. It finances the WTE System, both construction and installation. The Operator manages the WTE System and pays an annual fixed payment to Moralltach as a yield.”And also:“Moralltach plans to allocate about 10% to 15% of its investment capital towards ‘blue sky’ projects which have the potential to earn high returns for its shareholders. While there are many projects that can be considered in this category, Moralltach intends to carefully scrutinize the market and profit potential for each project before committing funds to develop them.” Conclusion of MoralltachIf you have taken the time to read this article and visit the Moralltach website https://moralltachglobal.com you may still have some questions.
